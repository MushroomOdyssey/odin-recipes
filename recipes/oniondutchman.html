    <p>
        This copycat onion wrapped flying Dutchman is essentially a cheeseburger served in an onion "bun" that is
        tender, crisp, and sweet, and pairs perfectly well with the richness of the meat.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            1 large white onion
        </li>
        <li>
            3/4 pound ground beef round
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon kosher salt
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            4 slices American cheese, cut into thirds
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup mayonnaise
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon ketchup
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut four 1/2-inch thick slices from the center portion of the onion and discard the smaller ends for another
            use. Divide beef into 4 portions and form each portion into a very thin patty. Season patties with salt and
            pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add 2 onion slices to the pan and cook,
            undisturbed, about 2 minutes. Add 2 patties and continue to cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip
            onion and burger patties and continue to cook until golden brown pressing the burger as it cooks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 2 cheese slices to the top of one onion slice and both burger patties. Place one burger on the
            cheese-topped onion slice and top with the second burger patty. Place remaining onion slice overburger and
            press down. Flip burger and cook 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. Repeat with remaining
            onions, burger patties and cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine mayo, ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish in a small bowl and stir well. Serve with burgers.
        </li>
    </ol>
