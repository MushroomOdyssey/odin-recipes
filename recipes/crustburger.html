    <p>
        This is the Crustburger, a recipe that comes from Sean Brock of Joyland Restaurants. A very thin burger, cheese,
        and onion, are sandwiched in a flattened potato bun, toasted in a skillet until golden and crusty on both sides.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons softened butter
        </li>
        <li>
            1 potato hamburger bun
        </li>
        <li>
            2 ounces 70% lean ground beef
        </li>
        <li>
            salt and freshly gound black pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            1 very thin slice onion
        </li>
        <li>
            1 slice American cheese
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon mayonnaise
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons ketchup
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 teaspoon fish sauce
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat a heavy skillet or griddle over medium heat. Spread butter over top of bun and bottom of bottom bun and
            place in skillet. Press down firmly with a spatula to completely flatten buns. Cook until toasted on both
            sides and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase the heat under the skillet to medium-high. Place meat in a mounded ball into the hot skillet and
            press firmly to flatten with a spatula. Gently work the spatula in a circular motion to form a very thin
            patty with jagged edges. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place onion on top and cook until browned around the edges. Top with cheese and cook until cheese melts.
            Scrape burger from the skillet and place on top of the bun top. Invert the other bun so that the inside of
            the bun is now the outside. Place burger back in skillet and cook about 1 minute on each side.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir mayonnaise, ketchup, hot sauce, and fish sauce together in a small bowl. Serve sauce alongside the
            burger.
        </li>
    </ol>
