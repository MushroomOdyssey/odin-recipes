    <p>
        The famous Juicy Lucy burger is a favorite of Minnesotans. It's so good! You must use American cheese on this to
        achieve the juiciness in the middle.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            1 1/2 pounds ground beef
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            3/4 teaspoon garlic sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            4 slices American cheese
        </li>
        <li>
            4 hamburger buns, split
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and garlic salt together in a bowl until well combined. Form
            into eight thin patties, each slightly larger than a cheese slice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stack all cheese slices and cut into four squares. Place one small cheese stack in the center of a beef
            patty; cover with another beef patty and tightly pinch the edges together to seal around the cheese. Be sure
            to seal tightly, or the cheese will burst through when cooked. Repeat with the remaining cheese and patties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until well browned, about 4
            minutes; they will puff up due to steam from the melting cheese. Flip patties, prick the tops to release
            steam, and cook until browned on the other side and no longer pink in the center; about 4 more minutes. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve on hamburger buns.
        </li>
    </ol>
